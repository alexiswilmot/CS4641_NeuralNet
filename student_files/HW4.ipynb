    "A dropout layer is a regularization technique used in neural networks to reduce overfitting. During training, a dropout layer looks at each input unit and randomly decide if it will be dropped (set to zero) with some given probability $p$. The decision for each unit is made independently. Formally, given an input of shape $N \\times K$ (where $N$ is the number of data points and $K$ is the number of features), it samples from $\\text{Bernoulli}(p)$ for each unit, resulting in an output where approximately $pNK$ of the units are zero (in expectation). This forces the network to learn more robust and generalizable features, since it cannot rely too much on any particular input. During inference, the dropout layer is turned off, and the full network is used to make predictions.\n",

Researchers have worked to make CNN models deeper and deeper over the past years in an effort to gain higher accuracy in predictions.

The backpropagation algorithm makes a small change to each weight in such a way that the loss of the model decreases. Using the chain rule, we can find this gradient for each weight. But, as this gradient keeps flowing backwards to the initial layers, this value keeps getting multiplied by each local gradient. Hence, the gradient becomes smaller and smaller, making the updates to the initial layers very small, increasing the training time considerably.\n",

In an attempt to decrease the variance of an extra tree, we're going to use a technique called 'Bootstrap Aggregating' (often abbreviated 'bagging').

Based on what it was mentioned in the class, we randomly pick features in each split. We use a more general approach here to make the programming part easier. Let's randomly pick some features (65% percent of features) and grow the tree based on the pre-determined randomly selected features. Therefore, there is no need to find random features in each split.\n",
    "\n",
    "   c) Fit an extra tree to the subsample of data we've chosen to a certain depth.\n",

    "You can refresh your understanding with the [lecture notes](https://mahdi-roozbahani.github.io/CS46417641-spring2024/course/21-ensemble-learning-randomforest.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification for a random forest is then done by taking a majority vote of the classifications yielded by each tree in the forest after it classifies an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the <strong>random_forest.py</strong> file, complete the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <strong>\\_bootstrapping</strong>: this function will be used in `bootstrapping()`\n",
    "- <strong>fit</strong>: Fit the extra trees initialized in `__init__` with the datasets created in `bootstrapping()`. You will need to call `bootstrapping()`.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. In the Random Forest Class, X is assumed to be a matrix with num_training rows and num_features columns where num_training is the number of total records and num_features is the number of features of each record. y is assumed to be a vector of labels of length num_training.\n",
    "2. Look out for TODO's for the parts that need to be implemented\n",
    "3. If you receive any `SettingWithCopyWarning` warnings from the Pandas library, you can safely ignore them.\n",

    "\n",
    "In machine learning, hyperparameters are parameters that are set before the learning process begins. The max_depth, num_estimators, or max_features variables from 3.1 are examples of different hyperparameters for a random forest model. Let's first review the dataset in a bit more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we are a team of researchers working to track and document various information related to dry beans for a machine learning model that predicts what type of bean is represented. We know that there are multiple things to keep track of, such as the shapes and sizes that differentiate different types of beans. We will use the information we track and document in order to publish it for the general public.\n",
    "\n",
    "After much reflection within the research team, we come to the conclusion that we can use past observations on bean images to create a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use our random forest algorithm from Q3.1 to predict the bean type.\n",

    "\n",
    "While building tree-based models, it's common to quantify how well splitting on a particular feature in an extra tree helps with predicting the target label in a dataset. Machine learning practicioners typically use \"Gini importance\", or the (normalized) total reduction in entropy brought by that feature to evaluate how important that feature is for predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini importance is typically calculated as the reduction in entropy from reaching a split in an extra tree weighted by the probability of reaching that split in the extra tree. Sklearn internally computes the probability for reaching a split by finding the total number of samples that reaches it during the training phase divided by the total number of samples in the dataset. This weighted value is our feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about what this metric means with an example. A high probabiity of reaching a split on feature A in an extra tree trained on a dataset (many samples will reach this split for a decision) and a large reduction in entropy from splitting on feature A will result in a high feature importance value for feature A. This could mean feature A is a very important feature for predicting the probability of the target label. On the other hand, a low probability of reaching a split on feature B in an extra tree and a low reduction in entropy from splitting on feature B will result in a low feature importance value. This could mean feature B is not a very informative feature for predicting the target label. **Thus, the higher the feature importance value, the more important the feature is to predicting the target label.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, fitting a sklearn.ExtraTreeClassifier to a dataset automatically computes the Gini importance for every feature in the extra tree and stores these values in a **feature_importances\\_** variable. [Review the docs for more details on how to access this variable](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.ExtraTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.ExtraTreeClassifier.feature_importances_)\n",

By mapping the current feature x to a higher space with more features, linear SVM could be performed on the features in the higher space to learn a non-linear decision boundary.
